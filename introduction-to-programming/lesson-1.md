# Lesson 1: Introduction

**Exercise 1**

What is a REPL? What can you do with it?

**Exercise 2**

Use the REPL to print all your names.

**Exercise 3**

Using the REPL, store the value â€˜Pythonâ€™ in a variable named â€˜my_favorite_languageâ€™.

**Exercise 4**

Use 4 variables to store numeric values (whatever you want) and combine them into operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc).

**Exercise 5**

Same as previous one, but instead of simple operations, create expressions with more than 4 operators (per expression).

**Exercise 6**

Use two variables to store two string values ("Hello" and "World" is an option). Then use print combining those to variables to print "Hello World".

**Exercise 7**

Create a file called `my_first_python_script_group_X.py` (X should be your group number). That script should store two variables with the values 4 and 7 and print the result of the sum of those values. Execute the script using the bash console, and also with the `Run` function on Cloud9.

**Exercise 7**

Given a variable with a string stored in it (for example "Python") try to print that value 5 times. For example, it should print "PythonPythonPythonPythonPython" if you used "Python" as your value.
